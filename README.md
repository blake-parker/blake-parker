# 👻Blake Parker

My name is Blake Parker. I am currently a senior pursuing a degree in Computer Science/Software Engineering at Louisiana State University.

I have always loved technology. As a child I played far too many video games for my own good and had countless online interactions. Though possibly toxic, these interactions shaped me as a person and my interest in Computer Science sprouted from wanting to give back and provide the same experiences for countless others.

This section is heavily a work in progress and intended to be updated.
